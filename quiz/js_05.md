 # Question
 ```js
let greeting = "allo";
greeting[0]="h";
console.log(greeting);
```

 # Answer
`hello`ではない！
***Primitive Values Are Immutable***

# ヒント0
```js
const p = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. If the dog reacted, was it really lazy?';
console.log(p.replace('dog', 'monkey')); //?
```

# ヒント1
```js
let arr =[1,3,5];
let str = "pokemon"

console.log(arr[0]);<-- (1)
console.log(str[0]);<-- (2)
```
We can access the array’s first item and the string’s first character similarly. <br>
(1): 1<br>
(2): "p"

じゃあvalueの変更は？実際試してみるべし。
> A string is a primitive value, and all primitive values are immutable.

 ***Primitive Values***

- Undefined (undefined), used for unintentionally missing values.
- Null (null), used for intentionally missing values.
- Booleans 
- Numbers 
- BigInts (uncommon and new), used for math on big numbers.
- Strings 
- Symbols (uncommon), used to perform rituals and hide secrets.


***Objects and Functions***

- Objects ({} and others), used to group related data and code.
- Functions (x => x * 2 and others), used to refer to code.


>No Other Types<br>
>In JavaScript, there are no other fundamental value types other than the ones we have just enumerated. The rest are all objects! 

# Variables vs Values
```js
let str ="tree";
str ="new";
console.log(str);//?
```

output:`new`
- Variables are not values.
- Variables point to values.

# String.prototype.replace()[^1]
>The `replace()` method ***returns a new string*** with one, some, or all matches of a pattern replaced by a replacement. 

```js
const p = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. If the dog reacted, was it really lazy?';

console.log(p.replace('dog', 'monkey'));
// Expected output: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy monkey. If the dog reacted, was it really lazy?"


const regex = /Dog/i;
console.log(p.replace(regex, 'ferret'));
// Expected output: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy ferret. If the dog reacted, was it really lazy?"

```
